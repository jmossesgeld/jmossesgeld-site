summary: "It took a while but finally, I have finished implementing the Add New Employee and the Edit Employee functionality. Thanks to TypeScript, checking the properties of the objects became a breeze. There is no longer a need to code in darkness not knowing the types of the variables and the parameters of the functions. Also, TypeScript improves developer experience by providing powerful Intellisense and detecting errors in advance, and guides your hand to clean and maintainable code properly. OMG, I am never going back to plain Javascript. Lol just kidding."

Also, TypeScript improves developer experience by providing powerful Intellisense and detecting errors in advance, and guides your hand to clean and maintainable code properly. OMG, I am never going back to plain Javascript. Lol just kidding..
