# Day 2

### April 22, 2022

**3:41 PM**

This time I will proceed with the Employees component. The component will list all the employees enrolled on the system. I will first use a dummy data in JSON format which will be returned by an API. I will also implement the add employee and edit employee functionalities today.

**5:46 PM **

I finished creating my Employees Table. In the process, I also made a reusable table which only takes data as array of objects of type T and columns as array of column properties. I used the "generics" feature in TypeScript so that my reusable table will be type agnostic. 

This is my progress so far
