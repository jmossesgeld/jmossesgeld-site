title: "Rewriting My Payroll App - Day 1"
date: "2022-04-21"
summary: "It has been a while since I made the app so I reviewed the code then I realized that there is a lot of room for improvements especially now that I gained more skill and experience as compared back then. Now, I plan to re-write the whole thing from scratch and use Typescript instead of just Javascript, Next.js instead of just React.js and Tailwind instead of MaterialUI. I also plan add authentication using Firebase and database integration using Firestore SDK.
I will detail my progress each day on this post."

The payroll app was one of the major projects I made when I was starting. The stack I used was Javascript, React.js for frontend and Material UI for styling. It has been a while since I made the app so I reviewed the code then I realized that there is a lot of room for improvements especially now that I gained more skill and experience as compared back then.

Now, I plan to re-write the whole thing from scratch and use Typescript instead of just Javascript, Next.js instead of just React.js and Tailwind instead of MaterialUI. I also plan add authentication using Firebase and database integration using Firestore SDK.

I will detail my progress each day on this post.

# Day 1

**2:01 AM**

I will start simple this day. I will setup the app by using the "create-next-app --ts" command (includes TypeScript) and Tailwind dependencies.

**2:28 AM**

Setup has been finished. I will now go create the homepage and the navigation bar.

**3:30 AM**

After almost an hour of grueling this is what I came up with:
